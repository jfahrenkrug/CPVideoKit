h1. CPVideoKit for Cappuccino

Please take a look at "this demo":http://github.com/jfahrenkrug/CPVideoKitDemo.

h2. Usage

Copy the CPVideoKit folder to your project's Frameworks folder and include @@import <CPVideoKit/CPVideoKit.j>@ in your class/controller/whatever.
Then create your VideoView as you would create a normal CPView, or use Atlas and a custom view.

This is very much a work in progress. I plan to add Vimeo and search support soon.

Have fun!
